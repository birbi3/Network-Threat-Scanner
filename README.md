# Network-Threat-Scanner
A scanner that looks for potential threats on networks


It is a work in progress. I would like to utilize nmap and compare the results to vulnerability databases. If you follow this project there will be times where I am going to upload unfinished functions and stuff that looks like junk. Remember it is a work in progress 
Feedback would be greatly appreciated.
