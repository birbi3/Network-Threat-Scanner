# Network-Threat-Scanner
A scanner that looks for potential threats on small business or home networks.
It is being designed to be something you have run in in the background once a week to collect data about your network. 

It is a work in progress. I would like to utilize nmap and compare the results to vulnerability databases. If you follow this project there will be times where I am going to upload unfinished functions and stuff that looks like junk. Remember it is a work in progress.


#Feedback would be greatly appreciated!
